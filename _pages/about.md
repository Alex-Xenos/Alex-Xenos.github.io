I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Department of Machine Learning and Systems Biology](https://www.biochem.mpg.de/borgwardt) at the [Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry](https://www.biochem.mpg.de/), led by [Prof. Karsten Borgwardt](https://www.biochem.mpg.de/borgwardt).

Before joining the MPI, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC)](https://www.bsc.es/) holding an AI4Science fellowship granted by the Spanish Ministry of Science. I obtained my PhD from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.upc.edu/) at the [Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC)](https://www.upc.edu/). At UPC, I was advised by [Prof. Natasa Przulj](https://www.cs.upc.edu/~natasha/) and was a member of the interdisciplinary research group [Barcelona Biomedical Genomics Lab](https://www.cs.upc.edu/~natasha/). During my PhD, I had the opportunity to spend some time at [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/) at the [Zitnik Lab](https://zitniklab.hms.harvard.edu/). I received my Diploma (BSc and MEng equivalent) in Applied Mathematical and Physical Sciences from the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/). I completed my master thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Aristotelis Chatziioannou](https://www.eie.gr/nhrf/institutes/ibrb/bioinformatics/chatziioannou_en.html).
